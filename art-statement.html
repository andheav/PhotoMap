          My work focuses on the role in which aviation has played in my family. My father and grandfather 
          are both non-commercial, “experimental aircraft” pilots. As a child, I was influenced in many ways 
          to love this hobby as well, but as I grew older my interests diverged. This collection of photos 
          combines two things: my father’s love for flying, and my interests in photography and technology. 
          These two activities together allow us the opportunity to connect and spend time together. The 
          aerial landscapes/satellite map diptychs are meant to portray the duet between my interests in 
          photography/technology, while the photos of the inside of my father’s hangar and the photos of my 
          father and grandfather together are meant to portray my family’s love for aviation.

          Additionally, I chose to portray the images in a format that was suited to both my interests and the skills
          that I’m building throughout my education. This format allows the reader to follow along our flight path as 
          we traversed it. From leaving the airport where my father currently resides to making a pit stop at my grandfather’s 
          rural Minnesotan farm, the viewer can follow along on this casual November afternoon flight.
