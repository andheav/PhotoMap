# PhotoMap

This project utilizes the Google Maps API to go to certain parts of central 
Minnesota where I grew up, and pairs these locations on the map with the photos
I took when I went flying with my dad. I had been looking to do some kind of project
that used the Google Maps API ever since I lived in Alaska for the summer, so this
project for my Intro to Photography class became the perfect culprit.

Sometime in the next couple of weeks or months, I would like to implement a few things:
  1. I would like to implement an "Enable Markers" button next to the next and back buttons
     which will toggle the visibility of the markers on the map.
  2. I would like to make this mobile friendly by having the map alone and then placing
     the images in custom info windows using the Google Maps API. 
  3. I would like to incorporate React or another frontend framework in order to load images 
     and their map locations simply by inserting a component into the DOM. This would enable 
     expansion of the project as I can associate a list of coordinates with a list of images 
     and have everything stored in one component.

Eventually, it would be nice to incorporate some kind of database framework to make the project
more expandable.

Thanks for taking a look!
